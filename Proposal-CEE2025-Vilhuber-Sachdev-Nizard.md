# Title: Practical Training in Reproducible Methods for Undergraduates: Scaling the AEA Reproducibility Verification into the Classroom

**Authors**: Vilhuber, Lars (lars.vilhuber@cornell.edu); Sachdev, Takshil; Nizard, Ilanith (all Cornell University)

For the past 7 years, the LDI Replication Lab has verified the computational reproducibility of papers appearing in AEA journals. Over 180 undergraduate students have participated in this activity. They received intensive training at the start of their participation, and gain experience throughout. This poster will identify how to scale this particular way of teaching reproducibility into a classroom-based, semester-long activity. We believe, based on feedback from "graduates" of the Lab, that the experience of hands-on engagement with data and code for conditionally accepted manuscripts is highly beneficial to the education and professional development of the students employed as Replication Interns (see also Vilhuber et al, 2022). 

Exposure to and training in well-structured programming will benefit students both in academia and the private sector. While students will not be trained to become active programmers, they will be trained to become **resourceful in debugging** (inevitably) imperfect code submitted to journals. They are also taught how to **communicate** with other people on technical problems, in an objective and constructive manner. They practice this while preparing reports for authors.  Such skills are useful in academic and private sector settings for both technical and non-technical feedback mechanisms. We believe that classroom training fills a gap, as we have repeatedly trained students in these skills precisely  in order to remediate the absence of such skills in students after 2-3 years of college.

We have conducted pilot studies in the past three summers with about 20 non-Cornell students from various universities and colleges. This has allowed us to identify the necessary pre-requisites, as well as the technical tooling and setup available in a broader setting. We believe that such a classroom activity can be implemented in many colleges and universities at the undergraduate level, and hope to discuss with attendees of the poster session. 

One key issue is how to obtain realistic input -- the replication code accompanying submitted journals. While initial training can happen on recently published articles, a steady flow of non-time-sensitive articles is needed. If implemented at various colleges, we plan to organize a "pool" of articles to which authors, wishing to submit to journals, can submit their code, and can expect a realistic response within 2-3 months. A pool of "editors", which need not be the instructor themselves, can handle reviewing the real reports that get sent back to real authors. A long-term outcome of this is for students to see, possibly within a year, the results of their recommendations being published as replication packages at journals. 

Lars Vilhuber is a Senior Research Associate at Cornell University, executive director of the Labor Dynamics Institute, and faculty in the Economics Department. Takshil Sachdev is a Ph.D. candidate in the Economics Department. Ilanith Nizard is pre-doc with with the LDI Replication Lab. All three have been involved in the training of undergraduate students in reproducible research methods for the LDI Replication Lab.
